# **App Name**: FinanceSim

## Core Features:

- Real-time Financial Ticker: Display streaming financial data, including micro and macro economic indicators.
- Financial Statements: Generate current balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement based on real-time data.
- Interactive Simulation Sliders: Provide interactive sliders to adjust internal, micro, and macro parameters for simulations.
- Natural Language Simulation Input: Allow users to enter simulation parameters via natural language using a chatbot, translating inputs into simulation configurations.
- Impact Simulation Tool: Simulate the impact of parameter changes (price, interest rates, forex rates) on the company's business and finances. The LLM will use its reasoning capabilities to decide which business factors are likely to be impacted and should be included in its calculations.
- Recommendation Engine: Provide suggestions on how to optimize business strategies based on simulation results.
- Simulation history: Allow saving of the results of simulation in a Cloud SQL database.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke trust and stability.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#D3DDEB) to complement the deep blue without overwhelming it.
- Accent color: Vivid purple (#8a3ffc) to highlight interactive elements and key data points.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use financial and business-themed icons with a modern, minimalist style.
- Implement a glass morphism UI for a modern, translucent design with frosted glass effects.
- Use subtle, smooth animations to transition between simulations and data displays.
